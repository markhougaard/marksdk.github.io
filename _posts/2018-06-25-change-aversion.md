I was reminded of this again recently, but more like so:

> It is difficult to get a man to change something, when he thinks his job depends on not changing it.

I think most people would say they're pretty happy with changes happening, but nobody's really happy with changes. It takes time and effort to upend your ways of working or being, so you resist.

The only way forward is to be open, both if you're trying to change something for someone, or if you're presented with a change you did't ask for.
