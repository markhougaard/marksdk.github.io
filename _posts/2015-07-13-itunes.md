- What's the difference between "+" and "♥"?<br>- When an album ends, everything stops. Auto-play me some more like what I just heard.<br>- I subscribe to the stream. Why can I still buy stuff?<br>- I want to click on artist names and albums. Why is that a right-click and "Go to album"? Never mind the fact that it only works some of the time.<br>- I'm listening to an album. I see "Albums you may also like". That's nice. Oh, there's an album I haven't heard in a long time. Let me just add this to "Up Next". Why can't I do that?.<br>- I'm listening to an album that I gave a ♥
. Why can I ♥ an individual song from that album too?

Plusses:

- So much Dylan, Metallica, Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Hank Williams etc. structured nicely into albums that actually make sense.<br>- Better sound? Might be my ears playing tricks on me.<br>
