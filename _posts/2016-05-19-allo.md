For some reason, Google made a new messaging app called "Allo":

> In the example Google showed us, a graduation photo came through. The suggested replies were along the lines of "Congratulations!" and "You look great!" Think for a moment about what it takes to do that. Google recognized it was a graduation photo and then went a step beyond just guessing what it was, it guessed at appropriate responses. And even beyond that, the responses are grouped into little meaning clusters â€” so you get a range of possible reactions instead of just variations on the same theme.

I simply cannot comprehend why this is a thing that exists.
