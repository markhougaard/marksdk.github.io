[Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/disney-magicband/):

> IF YOU WANT to imagine how the world will look in just a few years, once our cell phones become the keepers of both our money and identity, skip Silicon Valley and book a ticket to Orlando. Go to Disney World. Then, reserve a meal at a restaurant called Be Our Guest, using the Disney World app to order your food in advance.

[…]

If you're wearing your Disney MagicBand and you've made a reservation, a host will greet you at the drawbridge and already know your name—Welcome Mr. Tanner! She'll be followed by another smiling person—Sit anywhere you like! Neither will mention that, by some mysterious power, your food will find you.


If there ever was a place to test technologies that feel like magic*, Disneyland would be the place.

<small>*"Magic" in this case meaning suspension of disbelief. When you check your reservations at the door, the designers can take the experience a little further.</small>
