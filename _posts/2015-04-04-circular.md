The "Runcible" is [a neat idea](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/looking-outside-rectangle-breakthrough-gadget/).

Few things excite me more than taking something you thought you knew, and upending the concept completely.

I love to think about how [Opbeat](http://opbeat.com) could work on such a device.
