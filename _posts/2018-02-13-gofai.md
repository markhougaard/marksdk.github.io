[Very, very good article from MIT Tech Review on the current state of AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609318/the-great-ai-paradox/). We're no closer to achieving "thinking computers because they're still as dumb and racist as their creators.

_GOFAI_ is still a pipe dream:

> Is it possible to give machines the power to think, as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and other originators of AI intended 60 years ago? Doing that, Levesque explains, would require imbuing computers with common sense and the ability to flexibly make use of background knowledge about the world. Maybe it's possible. But there's no clear path to making it happen. That kind of work is separate enough from the machine-learning breakthroughs of recent years to go by a different name: GOFAI, short for "good old-fashioned artificial intelligence."
