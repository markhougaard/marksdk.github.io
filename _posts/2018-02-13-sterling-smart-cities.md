[Bruce Sterling in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/stupid-cities/553052/):

> The new Chinese smart-city model isn't London at all, but rather "Baidu-Macau," where the state-approved social-media giant shows up in the sleepy ex-Portuguese gambling town, and offers to ramp up the local action. For instance, embedding Chinese AI facial recognition into all the town's police security cameras.

> Brand-new Brazilian AI security cams are arriving in Mumbai, Delhi, and Agra, too. That's pretty interesting, in its dramatic Orwellian fashion, but I'm not sure it's as important to city life as it may sound. Gang kids in Chicago like to voluntarily wave automatic weapons on YouTube while chanting death threats; they're auto-surveilling themselves.

I don't care if Sterling's thoughts are too far out or whateverâ€”that's some proper good writing either way.
