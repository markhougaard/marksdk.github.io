[Photoshop Design Space](http://adobe-photoshop.github.io) looks interesting, but I couldn't help smiling at the features:

* Artboards<br>* Less Clutter<br>* Easier Selection

Kudos to the Photoshop team for doing something about it, but you know you're starting out in a bad place when two out of three features directly refer to how terrible the outright usability of Photoshop currently is.

I'll try it out, and see if I can move past where I'm usually stuck in Photoshop: How to draw a straight line and select it afterwards.

_Ten minutes later..._

Nope, still can't figure out how to reliably select what I want, how to zoom on what I want, or measure distances between elements \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af

I'm firmly convinced that every single web designer using Photoshop is trapped there because they are afraid they wasted their time trying to understand the tool, rather than questioning whether the tool is right for the job. They don't want to admit that they are doing a ton of unnecessary hoops to accomplish even the simplest of tasks.
