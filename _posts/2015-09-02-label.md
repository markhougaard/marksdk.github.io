This is a photo of a door that you can open. You open the door by pressing a button. That button is so far from the door they had to put three stickers on the door and the wall next to it, so you'd know where to look for the button.

Oh, the button has a label too, because otherwise you'd never know what the button does.

This is my new favorite example of why labels and guides and the like are often getting us too far from the most obvious solution. I don't care if the button needs to be close to the alarm system's keypad; there's a better solution that doesn't adhere to the requirements of the system at the expense of user friendliness, and they should have used it.
