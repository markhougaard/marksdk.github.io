[This article is just brilliant](https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85):

> Modern UI teams are designing components first; Interfaces are merely the thoughtful composition of components. This leaves an often glaring hole for users on "the unhappy path". As we learn to craft systems rather than pages, we must invest effort into shaping these often missed states of design and create with a component lifecycle that can support everyone.

I want to get better at this. It really should be a part of the methodology when designing anything from now on.
