> Designing for messaging will become a discipline as important as responsive design, and will incorporate skills as diverse as copy writing, business analytics and API programming. You thought microcopy was important now!

From [this post on Medium](https://medium.com/@benbrown/slack-is-the-operating-system-6bae1a6c0291).

Phil Gyford asked on Twitter who wrote a good piece about text-based messaging interfaces, and of course it was on BERG's blog:

Slack-integrations are, as Slack itself, super hot right now, but I don't think it's a fad. There's something about just asking for stuff in a natural way and letting the computer figure out what's the best answer. Siri (etc.) comes close, but I don't like talking to computers. I want to write them instead, which makes the Slack "bots" perfect.

At [Opbeat](http://opbeat.com), we've set up a few bots in Slack for delegating stuff on Pagerduty (*"put X on primary from now"*-ish) or figuring out who's in charge of a staging server (*"sudo server claim production"*, with *sudo* being our version of [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com)).

Those text commands have a graphical UI somewhere as well, but it's just so much more fun and efficient talking to them.
