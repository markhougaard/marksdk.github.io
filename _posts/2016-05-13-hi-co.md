> We're closing Hi.co on September 1, 2016. But, paradoxically, there's never been a more meaningful moment to join. We're making a "book." We're printing\u200a窶能u200ausing a microscopic ion-etching process\u200a窶能u200athe entire website upon a 2" \u00d7 2" nickel plate, giving it a fire- and saltwater-resistant shelf life of 10,000 years. At least five plates will be produced, to be held by five stewards\u200a窶能u200amuseums and libraries\u200a窶能u200aaround the world. A seed bank of our moments as connected to place. We met with the collections director and preservation specialists at the Library of Congress in early April of 2016, and the Library has agreed to be our first official steward.
