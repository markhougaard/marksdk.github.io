> There is some self-loathing, but self-loathing, after all, is just egomania with heartburn.

There's a sentence I wish I'd written. It's from [Pitchfork's article on Kanye's album "808s & Heartbreak"](http://pitchfork.com/features/overtones/9725-the-coldest-story-ever-told-the-influence-of-kanye-wests-808s-heartbreak/), which the author argues is his most influential.

I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's an interesting premise and it was definitely influentialâ€”I just think "Yeezus" did more to push the limits of what hiphop is and can aspire to be, and that reached beyond just hiphop or rap as genres and into music as a whole.
