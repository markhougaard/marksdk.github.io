> 2017 is to 2000 as 1977 is to 1960. In 1977, you could by all means have thought 1960 was a fucking long time ago and be nostalgic for that time. It's just as valid of a thing to, today, be interested in 2000.

â€” _James Murphy_, from [an interview in Vulture right before LCD's return](http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/james-murphy-on-lcd-soundsystems-return.html).

I hadn't thought about it like that. 17 years is a long time, but 1960 to 1977 seems like a longer span than 2000 and 2017. It doesn't have to.
