> But the job of a product manager isn't to understand analytics, it is to understand customers. Too often, the term "data-driven" leads to a mindset that values numbers above the people from whom those numbers are collected. If our goal is simply to drive specific charts up and to the right, then we will optimize for whatever drives those specific charts up and to the right, even if it comes at the expense of our customers and the reality of our products.
