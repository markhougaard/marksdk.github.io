For all the shit that we're collectively giving Apple these days, here's an antidote:

I ordered the Nike+ branded Apple Watch because I figured it'd be worth more than a GPS running watch in itself.

In a (not really) surprising turn of events, I found out that the Apple Watch is actually a pretty dumb gimmick that doesn't really give you much other than notifications on your wrist (I'm sure it'll be more at a later time, but not right now). Having used the Watch for a week, I was anxious about whether they'd actually take it back (the Watch itself looked brand new, but the band was showing a bit of use).

They did indeed take it back and reimbursed me for the full amount, no questions asked.

How many other brands actually do that? I was pleasantly surprised Apple did.
