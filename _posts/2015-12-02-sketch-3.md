Lots of great advice in Meng To's articleâ€”especially this one:

> Make Grid makes it easy to duplicate anything, for any amount of copies in a grid style. You can set the spacing between the elements or have them enclosed in boxes before duplicating. This is specifically useful for handling List (Table View) and Grid (Collection View) interfaces, or simply rearrange layers in an orderly fashion.

See the video [in the article](https://designcode.io/sketch-mastering) for the full effect.
