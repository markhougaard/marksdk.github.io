> I'd like to ask, how many of you have been to San Francisco (about a quarter of the audience raises their hands).<br>> <br>> How many of you were shocked by the homelessness and poverty you saw there? (most of the hands stay up.)<br>> <br>> For the rest of you, if you visit San Francisco, this is something you're likely to find unsettling. You'll see people living in the streets, many of them mentally ill, yelling and cursing at imaginary foes. You'll find every public space designed to make it difficult and uncomfortable to sit down or sleep, and that people sit down and sleep anyway. You'll see human excrement on the sidewalks, and a homeless encampment across from the city hall. You'll find you can walk for miles and not come across a public toilet or water fountain.
