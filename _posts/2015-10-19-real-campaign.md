> Mr. Trump has spent more on hats and T-shirts — about $678,000 — during the three months ending Sept. 30 than he did on field staff and offices in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where those expenses totaled just $353,363, or on advertising, voter list rentals and campaign materials.

> "We are a real campaign," said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's campaign manager.
