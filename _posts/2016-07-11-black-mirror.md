This short film, "Never Happened" by Mark Slutsky is like an ultra-brief Black Mirror episode.

Speaking of, the third season of Black Mirror was a bit of a bumpy ride. The first episode is ridiculous and should have been a 10-minute short film at most, while the third episode is one of the most anguishing hours of tv I've ever seen. Like a deep, solid gut punch. The rest of the episodes fall somewhere in-between that.
