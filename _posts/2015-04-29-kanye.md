> Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't.

Big words [from Elon Musk on Kanye](http://time.com/3822841/kanye-west-2015-time-100/) at Time's 100 Most Influential People list.

Kanye is the biggest phenomenon that is working in the design and arts world today, and it's well deserved he's on that list, and so far up to bootâ€”even if it's not ranked, it speaks volumes about his influence that they chose him for one of only a handful of covers.
