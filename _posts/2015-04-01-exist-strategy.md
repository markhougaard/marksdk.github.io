Natasha Lampard of Webstock, [on the longest-running company in the world](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/natasha-lampard/2015-March-27), an _onsen_ in Japan that's 1300 years old:

I've been thinking about startups lately. There's something about that term that grosses me out.

A startup shouldn't be the end goal in itself. It's a business. A company that's just starting out.

What if we started thinking of new companies as "startouts" instead?
