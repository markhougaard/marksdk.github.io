With the old iOS6 UI, for some reason.

There's also the new iPod Shuffles. The only new feature: VoiceOver. Press a button and it tells you what's playing. That's nice.

But with all of that streaming business Apple's been doing lately, why such a dumb device? An internet-connected Shuffle would be amazing. Click through 10 songs. Up/down to vote on what's nice. Genious-button to hear more like that. It'd work well.<br>http://www.apple.com/ipod-shuffle/
