This is so great, and I've been looking for the "when you're fundraising, it's AI..."-tweet for months, so I'm collecting the nuggets here for me to peruse:

[Hit it, @random_walker](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/976836626121977858):

> Tech buzzwords explained:
>
> AI: *regression*
> 
> Big data: *data*
> 
> Blockchain: *database*
> 
> Algorithm: *automated decision-making*
> 
> Cloud: *Internet*
> 
> Crypto: *cryptocurrency*
> 
> Dark web: *Onion service*
> 
> Data science: *statistics done by nonstatisticians*
> 
> Disruption: *competition*
> 
> Viral: *popular*
> 
> IoT: *malware-ready device*

[Boom, here's $100m to drain the statistics department of the nearest university](https://mobile.twitter.com/xaprb/status/930674776317849600):

> When you're fundraising, it's AI
> 
> When you're hiring, it's ML
> 
> When you're implementing, it's linear regression
> 
> When you're debugging, it's printf()

[This was fun too](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/976843927335702530):

> When computer scientists say "big data" they usually mean data that's big enough that you can't process it on a single machine.

[And](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/976844584767709185):

> Some people use "big data" to mean something like "large-scale, fine-grained data about people that can be used to make harmful inferences about them."

[You get an algorithm, and you get an](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/976846151814180866)...:

> If you're a technologist confused about headlines like these, it turns out that "algorithm" now means "automated decision-making".

[Viral like the flu, if it was the Outbreak monkey coughing on you](https://mobile.twitter.com/random_walker/status/976848812034621440):

> Finally, "viral". @duncanjwatts & other have a fascinating claim, backed by data, that viral propagation on social media is largely a myth, and that the popularity of (say) tweets is explained by the popularity of the most prominent user who retweeted it.

There were some nice ones in the responses as wellâ€”I think there's [more truth in this one](https://mobile.twitter.com/aexia/status/976941690144641025) that anyone will ever admit:

> AI: *Excel*
>
> Big data: *Excel*
>
> Blockchain: *Excel*
>
> Algorithm: *Excel*
>
> Cloud: *Google spreadsheet*
>
> Crypto: *Excel*
>
> Dark web: *Excel*
>
> Data science: *Excel chart*
>
> Disruption: *Excel 2018*
>
> Viral: *Excel macros*

[Artificial Intelligence = another human's brain](https://mobile.twitter.com/alcal74/status/977024501895573504):

> Also, Machine Learning: Low paid foreigners looking at or filtering content

Bonus: [The best ELI5 of Bitcoin I've come across so far](https://mobile.twitter.com/Alex_Danco/status/977035951934341122):

> Your report card is posted publicly, as is everybody else's, at 3 pm. Everyone fights with each other for the chance to put them in the principal's secure filing cabinet. If you win the fight, you get an A in gym. You can sell the A to other students in exchange for drugs.
