[This episode](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-129-rukmini-callimachi-part-1) of the Longform podcast is absolutely terrific.<br><br>It's usually a great podcast, but this took it to another level. Callimachi knows her stuff, isn't afraid to make controversial points, but above all, listening to this episode made me feel a whole lot smarter about a subject I thought I already knew a lot about.<br><br>Highly recommended!<br><br>> https://twitter.com/longformpodcast/status/568115373716807680
