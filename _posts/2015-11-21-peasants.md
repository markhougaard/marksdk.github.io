Great paragraph in this article by Helen V. Holmes, "[The Future of Wearables](http://helenvholmes.com/the-future-of-wearables/):

> A non-mechanical watch beeps on my bedside table, demanding attention. I'm immediately angry: how dare it presume to be worthy of my attentions without me expressly giving them. I sometimes talk to tech this way. They're supposed to be peasants but more often they're the 3 ounce rock of heroin sitting in my pocket.
