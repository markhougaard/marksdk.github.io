[Mary H. K. Choi](https://medium.com/matter/eat-pray-roll-8bdb761c986d):

> Being an adult is to feel hyperfamiliar with everything. When we were young we did drugs because they were exciting and new. New is a lost cause but these days I'd settle for weird. I welcome synthetic curiosity. Whether you're pulling out your medical marijuana card or doing ayahuasca or dabbling in psilocybin, LSD, or DMT, it's to other the familiar. I understand Burning Man. I even get "the second weekend of Coachella." I know why people have children. Seeing yourself in another person must be fun when you're so over yourself on your own. I wonder if not having kids is what being a vampire feels like. Where you're just sort of casually unimpressed and stuck there.

Great story!
