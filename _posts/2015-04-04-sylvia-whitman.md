[COS](http://www.cosstores.com/dk/Magazine/SS15/Sylvia/): 

> Sylvia Whitman inherited Shakespeare and Company, probably the most famous and certainly the most intriguing English-language bookshop in the world, from her father, George. The 17th-century building, directly across the Seine from Notre Dame Cathedral, is stuffed to the rafters with extraordinary stories. They are, of course, found in the pages of the many thousands of books that line the fairy-tale maze of rooms. But they're also there in the history of the shop itself, which has been a meeting place for writers for almost a century.

No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to Shakespeare & Co., and [this interview](http://www.cosstores.com/dk/Magazine/SS15/Sylvia/) made me want to go again right away.
