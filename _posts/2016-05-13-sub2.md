The Times is in on the quest for the two-hour marathon with a long profile of Yannis Pitsiladis who's leading the "Sub2"-project.

The scientific approach is really interesting, but this is a great point as well:

> "I no longer believe we should be pushing the pace" to reach a two-hour marathon, said Mary Wittenberg, a former race director of the New York City Marathon and an influential voice in international distance running.
>
> "I think, at a period in this sport's history where doping has become a real concern, that we should do everything we can to go back to racing and competition and not superhuman feats," Wittenberg said.

There's something about throwing all of the stupid time tracking aside, and just _race_. Like really race and just win one man or woman in front of the other.
